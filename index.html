                        <p>
                     Kyle Coleman is currently the VP, Revenue Growth & Enablement @ Clari. Clari uses automation and AI to unlock all the activity data captured in key business systems, including marketing automation, CRM, email, calendar, phone, content management, conversations and more.
                         <br>
                       Kyle "KC" Coleman was one of the first hires of a tech company called Looker which eventually was acquired by Google in 2019.  KC has a soft spot for SDRs as he is always posting great content on LinkedIn about how differently Clari likes to view their sales team.  In fact, most of the senior leadership team at Clari were SDRs at some point in their careers.

                        <p>
                       Today we will be chatting with the Thomas Jansen, a US Army Veteran, pre-HIRED graduate, and most recently an SDR at Advantax!
                       <br>
                       After transitioning out of the military in December 2013, Thomas landed some work as an Automotive Mechanic and shortly after he 
                         decided to explore a career in tech sales after receiving an ad for the 100% remote pre-HIRED science based sales program. 
                         Through pre-HIRED's program he learned the basic fundamentals of cold calling, tools used in an SDR role, and received mentorship 
                         on interview best practices.  Luckily enough he was able to land his first ever SDR role shortly after at Advantax and has nearly 
                         doubled his income.  I am so excited to see where Thomas' new career will take him and the opportunities that have now become 
                         available for him!
